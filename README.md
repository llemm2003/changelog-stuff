# changelog stuff
 Scripts related to changelogging. 

1. changelog.pl
	Just a changelog.sh wrapper. 
	
2. json_writer.sql
	Script that can be used to write json date to change.log. 
	It can be added to sql or plsql scripts to record atomic changes. This will avoid extra jobs/hacks on writing stuff to kibana.
